# bb-plugin-linear-issues

A BB plugin that adds a Linear page to the sidebar. You can browse your issues, open one, and start a BB thread from it with a prompt prefilled from the ticket.

## Setup

Create a personal API key in Linear (Settings → Security & access → Personal API keys), then either paste it into Settings → Plugins → Linear Issues or run:

```
bb plugin config linear-issues set apiKey <key>
```

The key is a secret setting. It stays on the BB server and never reaches the browser.

## What's in it

- `server.ts` is the backend. It holds the Linear GraphQL client, the RPC contract used by the page, and the `bb linear-issues` CLI.
- `app.tsx` is the page entry. The route `/plugins/linear-issues/issues/<IDENTIFIER>` opens an issue directly.
- `views/IssueList.tsx` shows the list. It has Assigned, Created and Subscribed scopes, search, a "show done" toggle, and groups issues by workflow state, sorted by priority.
- `views/IssueDetail.tsx` shows one issue: its metadata, description, sub-issues and comments, plus BB's new-thread composer seeded with the ticket.
- `lib/prompt.ts` builds that seeded prompt. The description is wrapped as untrusted reference data.
- `skills/linear-issues/SKILL.md` tells agents how to use `bb linear-issues show <id>`.
